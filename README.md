### 1. Project Description
#### A. Problem Statement
The TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) Trip Record Data provides extensive information on taxi trips in New York City, including those for yellow and green taxis. However, the sheer volume of data and redundancy pose challenges for meaningful analytics. Processing and analyzing such large datasets efficiently become crucial for extracting valuable insights and optimizing taxi services.

### Volume and Redundancy

**The dataset is vast, containing millions of records with redundant information.**

### Data Suitability

**The raw data may not be immediately suitable for analytics due to its sheer size and unstructured nature.**




#### B. Best Possible Solutions
- Housing Expert
- Intuition About House
- Using Machine Learning

#### C. Introduction About Project
House price prediction is a very stressful work, as we have to consider different things while buying a house, like the structure, rooms, kitchen, parking space, and gardens. People donâ€™t know about the factors that influence the house price. But by using Machine Learning, we can easily find the house which is perfect for us and helps to predict the price accurately.
